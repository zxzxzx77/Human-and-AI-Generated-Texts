This dataset comprises four distinct collections of text, each derived from two sources: Books handwritten fonts and text generated by GPT-4, an advanced artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI. Each subset varies in word count, providing a comprehensive basis for comparative analyses of human-style and AI-generated text across different lengths.

The dataset is divided into four subsets, each containing texts of increasing lengths. Both handwritten and AI-generated texts are included in each subset to facilitate direct comparisons.

Subset 1: 150 Words
Subset 2: 250 Words
Subset 3: 350 Words
Subset 4: 450 Words
Description: This subset includes texts with approximately 150 words each, sourced from both handwritten fonts and GPT-4 generated text.
Purpose: This collection serves as a basis for studying the characteristics and stylistic elements of short human-style handwritten text and comparing them with AI-generated text.
Data Analysis:Researchers can analyze the text for various linguistic, stylistic, and structural features. Comparative studies can be conducted to assess the differences and similarities between human-style handwritten and AI-generated text.
